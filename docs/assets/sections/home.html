<h1>What is Wakanda ?</h1>

<p>
	Wakanda is a full stack javascript platform for creating web, hybrid and native applications. Wakanda is composed of two main products:
	<ul class="list">
        <li>
            <strong>Studio:</strong> IDE that helps you troubleshoot your environement, develop your apps and test them locally.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Server:</strong> hosts and runs your Wakanda backend application during development and production.
        </li>  
    </ul>

<p>
    Wakanda Studio gives you a complete view of your application from the front to the back :
	<ul class="list">
        <li>
            <strong>Application Scaffolding:</strong> compose your app by selecting from a preconfigured list of templates :
            <ul>
            	<li>Backend: JavaScript, TypeScript..</li>
            	<li>Web: Angular4, Angular1.. (soon Aurelia and ReactJS)</li>
            	<li>Mobile: Ionic2, Ionic1.. (soon React Native)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Environement troubleshooting:</strong> dev tools and system configuration problems detection and solutions are prepared for you, so that you can concentrate on creating value
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Frameworks CLI integration:</strong> generate framework elements for Angular, Ionic and more directly from the studio without using the CLI through our integration with those frameworks command lines and dev tools
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Code Versioning:</strong> Git integration
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Debugger:</strong> Debug your backend code directly from the studio
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tasks:</strong> manage your app's running tasks (transpilation, filesystem watchers, livereloaders..), examine their output, stop, reload tasks.. from a centralized view for backend, mobile and web
        </li>  
        <li>
            <strong>Code edition and completion:</strong> completion for JS/TS/HTML/CSS.. and data model aware code completion for JS/TS backend files
        </li>  
    </ul>
    
<p>
    Wakanda Server is a multi-threaded server that lowers the cost of configuration and developement by providing pre-bundled components :
	<ul class="list">
	    <li>
	        <strong>JavaScript Application Server</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses V8 as JavaScript runtime</li>
                <li>Exposes a rich synchronous API to handle filesystem, sockets, HTTP Requests, built-in or remote databases, workers..</li>
                <li>Workers API so that you can use NodeJS modules, APIs and asynchronous style coding</li>
            </ul>
	    </li>
        <li>
            <strong>HTTP Server:</strong> exposes Wakanda's auto-generated REST API and can serve your application's static files
        </li>

                <li>Exposes a rich JavaScript API to access and manipulate data</li>
                <li>Provides events associated to data manipulation</li>
                <li>Secures access to data</li>
                <li>Exposes an automatically generated REST API to access and manipulate data</li>
            </ul>
        </li>  
        <li>
            <strong>WakandaDB (built-in dataBase)</strong>
        </li>
