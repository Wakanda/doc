<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>
    All you need to follow along is a wakanda studio that can be downloaded from 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://wakanda.github.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>
    Once the studio is installed, open it up and create your solution. In the solution creation dialog
    you can pick a name for your solution and select the project types and technologies you are interested in.
<p>    
    For this tutorial we will call our solution <code>todo</code> and we will be using the following projects :
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backend : </strong> Wakanda JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong>Web : </strong> Angular 4</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    Depending on the project types and technologies you've selected, dependencies and system
    configuration can be required, but don’t panic we’ve got your back. Once an issue is detected or a dependency
    is missing it will be displayed in the studio console.

    For example, by clicking on <code>Install Angular CLI</code> you will receive a full description of what is needed to fix the issue.

<p>
    After resolving all the issues detected by the studio troubleshooting, click the Run toolbar button. Behind the curtains an <code>npm
    install</code> followed by an <code>npm start</code> will be triggered.

<p>
Keep your application running and transpiling while we go through the tutorial.
