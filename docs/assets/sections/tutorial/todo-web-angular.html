<p>
	Earlier we've created a <b>TodoComponent</b>, all what you will see is <i>"Todo works"</i> message. It's not handy at all.
</p>
<p>
	Let's change that by editing our component in order to list the Todos :
</p>
<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/todo-component/read/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>
<p>Let's go through the code we added :</p>
<p>
	In order to fetch our list of tasks we make use of the connector Wakanda Javascript Client. But first of all, we need to
	retrieve our dataclass before working with it. In our case we want to use the class <b>Todo</b> that's why we pass an array
	with the dataclass name to <b> getCatalog </b>, then we call the <b>query()</b> method to retrieve our entities.
</p>
<p>
	The template is changed as well to display our todos individually. We modified the <b>li</b> tag by adding the directive
	<b>*ngFor</b> to iterate over the tasks and list them. we also added a <i>two way binding</i> between the input and the
	<i>newTodoText </i> property.
</p>

<p>
	We don't have any todos yet, if your browser updates all what you'll see is the input text.
</p>

<p>
	Let's change that and add the possibility to create todos.
</p>
<p>
	We simply add a new method <b>newTodo()</b> and call the methods <b>create()</b> and <b>save()</b> of wakanda-javascript-client.
	This saves the new element into our Todo class and adds it to the todos array.
</p>
<p>
	And in the html file we listen to changes in the input and when we click enter it creates the todo.
</p>

<p>Next we see how to update a todo label and toggle the checkbox.</p>

<p>This part is a bit twisted since the update requires the display of an input form when the user double click the todo label.
	For that we will add a temporary bool variable : <b>editing</b> to decide when to display or not the input. When the user
	hits enter we should hide the input and update the label with the new one. The css element <b>editing</b> will take care
	of hiding and showing the input when needed.
</p>

<p> Also we need to add a local variable <b>#editedTodo</b> and pass it to our <b>editTodo()</b> function, this way we will get
	the new todoâ€™s value.</p>


<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/todo-component/update/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>
<p>
	Update the label consists of three functions : the first one to set up the editing mode, the second to cancel the edit mode,
	and the last one to save the updated label into our table.
</p>
<p>
	Save the updated label into our table is achieved by passing the id of todo to the method
	<b>find()</b> of wakanda javascript client to find our todo and update the label. The same thing will be done to toggle
	the checkbox (<i>check the method (<b>toggleCompletion()</b></i>.)
</p>

<p>The last part is removing a todo. The delete action is straightforward : we add an event listener and we make use of wakanda-javascript-client
	method <b> Delete()</b> then we remove the first occurrence from the todos array.
</p>

<p>Our web application is almost ready, the last thing to do is adding a <b>logout</b> action.</p>
<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/web/angular/logout/" files="['todo.component.ts','todo.component.html']"></snippets>
<p>We simply use the <b>logout()</b> method, and we add a logout button to the bottom of the page !</p>
<p>
	Go ahead and check your application in the browser, everyhting should work as expected !
</p>
<p>
	Congratulations you made it this far !
