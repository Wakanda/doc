<h1>Threads</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    Wakanda provides a way to run JS code inside a thread: Worker.
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is three different types of worker: <code>SystemWorker</code>, <code>SharedWorker</code>, <code>NodeWorker</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each worker has its own thread; so it is non blocking and asynchronous.
        </li>
        <li>
            One or more worker proxies helps to send/receive messages to/from worker.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Use a :
    <ul>
        <li>System Worker when working with an external system application (ex: <code>git</code>, <code>shell</code>, ...)</li>
        <li>Shared Worker when executing Wakanda JS code in background</li>
        <li>Node Worker when executing Node JS code in background</li>
    </ul>
