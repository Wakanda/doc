<h2>Backend Authentication</h2>

<p>
The Directory is the part of Wakanda Server that handles user creation, removal, login, logout, assigning users
to specific groups and more.

<p>
In our TODO app we will identify every user by a login/password combination that has already been defined in the Directory editor inside Wakanda Studio.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    Later on, you can learn about adding users using the <a [routerLink]="['/guide']" [queryParams]="{section: 'main-auth'}">Directory</a> API.
</div>

<p>
To access the directory editor, click on the little man icon on the solution explorer.

<p>
Go ahead and create two users : Jenna Doe and John Doe

Let's also create a <code>todoUsers</code> group and add our two newly created users to it. This will come in handy in the next steps.

Later on, we will see how to use this group in order to secure access to a resource.
