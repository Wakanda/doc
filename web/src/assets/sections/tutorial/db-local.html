<h2>Backend DB Integration</h2>

<p>Wakanda server has a built-in database called <b>WakandaDB</b> that makes creating apps fun and easy.

<p> In this section we will create a simple Todo <a [routerLink]="['/guide']" [queryParams]="{section: 'main-data-basics'}">dataclass</a> and secure access to it by using the visual Model Editor.

<p>
	Go ahead and create a <code>Todo</code> dataclass:
</p>
<p> <img src="./assets/images/dataclass.gif" alt="Create a dataclass" class="gif-img"></p>

In terms of security we need the following :

<ul>
    <li>Only a logged in user can Read/Create/Remove/Update Todos</li>
    <li>A user can only create Todos for himself</li>
    <li>A user can only Update/Remove/Read his own Todos</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now letâ€™s add permissions to our datastore and grant the following privileges to the <code>todoUsers</code> group :
<ul>
	<li>Read : Read entities from the database.</li>
	<li>Create : Create a new entity.</li>
	<li>Update : Update an entity.</li>
	<li>Remove : Remove an entity.</li>
	<li>Describe : Access the class description.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Click on the <code>Todo</code> dataclass and in the section <code>Class Permissions</code> of the properties pannel select the group <code>todoUsers</code>
from the dropdown menu next to each action:

<p>
<img src="./assets/images/permissions.gif" alt="DataClass permissions" class="gif-img">

<p>
	What we've just did, will ensure that only logged in users who belong to the <code>todoUsers</code> group will have access to the dataclass <code>Todo</code>'s data.
	
<p>
	For an unauthenticated user this means :
	<ul>
	    <li>
	        Any operation on the the <code>Todo</code> dataclass using
	        Wakanda's <a [routerLink]="['/guide']" [queryParams]="{section: 'main-data-cs'}">auto-generated REST API</a>
	        or user <a [routerLink]="['/guide']" [queryParams]="{section: 'main-http'}">custom REST API</a> will <strong>fail</strong>.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	For an authenticated user who does not belong to the group <code>todoUsers</code> this means :
	<ul>
	    <li>
	        Any operation on the the <code>Todo</code> dataclass using
	        Wakanda's auto-generated REST API or custom REST API will <strong>fail</strong>.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	For an authenticated user who belongs to the group <code>todoUsers</code> this means :
	<ul>
	    <li>
	        Any operation on the the <code>Todo</code> dataclass using
	        Wakanda's auto-generated REST API or custom REST API will <strong>succeed</strong>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        A user can create Todos but put the ID of another user in the <code>userID</code> attribute.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        A user can read/remove/update Todos of another user.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	
To meet our security requirements we need to restrict each user access's to his own created Todos and stop a user from creating Todos for another user !
    
<p>
    To do so, we will make use of <a [routerLink]="['/guide']" [queryParams]="{section: 'main-data-basics'}">dataclass events</a> and more precisely the <code>save</code> and <code>restrict</code> dataclass events.

<p>
    Let's start by creating those events for the <code>Todo</code> dataclass.
<p>
    <img src="./assets/images/events.gif" alt="Create restrict and save events" class="gif-img">

For our <code>save</code> event, we will make sure the <code>userID</code> attribute can only be the ID of the user who sent the request to the server :

<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/ds/events/" files="['Todo-events-save.js']"></snippets>

And for the <code>restrict</code> event we will restrict all operations on the dataclass <code>Todo</code> to the the entities created by the user who sent the request to the server :

<snippets path="./assets/snippets/tutorial/ds/events/" files="['Todo-events-restrict.js']"></snippets>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	To learn more about the datastore events you can refer to the <a [routerLink]="['/guide']" [queryParams]="{section: 'main-data-basics'}">documentation</a>
</div>

<p>
    Our backend is ready with two users in the directory and an up and running data model. In the next section we will create the UI for Todos CRUD !
